This repository contains a simplified implementation of a linked list,
providing a flexible way to store and manage collections of data
and allowing for efficient insertions, deletions, and transversal operations.

# Node Class
The 'Node' class represents the fundamental building block of the linked list.
Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. 

# Linked List Class
The 'LinkedList' class provides the overall structure and operations for managing a linked list.
It uses instances of the 'Node' class to build and manipulate the list.
